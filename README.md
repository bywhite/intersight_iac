# Intersight IaC Wizard

[![published](https://static.production.devnetcloud.com/codeexchange/assets/images/devnet-published.svg)](https://developer.cisco.com/codeexchange/github/repo/scotttyso/intersight_iac)

## Updates/News

No New Items at this time.

## Getting Started

### Install json2hcl

[json2hcl](https://github.com/kvz/json2hcl)

### Python Requirements

- Python 3.6 or Greater

[python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)

- Refer to requirements.txt for libraries needed to be installed or simply install the requirements file as shown below:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Terraform Requirements

The script utilizes features introduced in 0.14 of Terraform.  So we need 0.14 or preferrably >1.0

[terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

### Terraform Modules and Providers

This script will utilize the Intersight Terraform Provider and two modules built off of the Intersight Provider.

- [Intersight Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CiscoDevNet/intersight/latest)
- [IMM Module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-cisco-modules/imm/intersight/latest)
- [Easy IMM](https://github.com/terraform-cisco-modules/terraform-intersight-easy-imm)

## Running the Wizard

- I recommend adding the following secure variables to your environment before running the script
```bash
## Intersight Variables
export TF_VAR_apikey="<your_intersight_api_key>"
export TF_VAR_secretkey=`cat ~/Downloads/SecretKey.txt` 
# This is an example based on the key being in your Downloads folder.  Correct for your environment

## Terraform Cloud Variables
export TF_VAR_terraform_cloud_token="<your_terraform_cloud_token>"
```

- Running the wizard to use a configuration migrated from UCS Manager using the IMM Transition Tool

```bash
./main.py {json_file_name.json}
```

- Running the Wizard to generate IaC through a Question and Answer Wizard

```bash
./main.py
```

## Synopsis

The purpose of this Python Tool is to deploy Policy/Profiles to Intersight using Infastructure as Code with Terraform.  The Wizard is a step for users to create and better understand how to utilize Terraform for managing infrastrudture.

The goal of this module is to begin to familiarize you with Terraform through the following steps:  

1. Begin to familiarize users with Terraform format and variable creation.  
2. Once a user feels conformatable with auto generated files, Transition towards writing your own modules to consume the IMM Modules.
3. And lastly build your confidence to write your own code as well.  

The wizard will show after each section what the Terraform code being generated will look like.  Point you to the directly where the code will be stored.  And lastly, publish the code to Terraform Cloud and when you are ready.

## Contents

- Use Cases
- Create Pools
- Create Policies
- Deploy UCS Domains in IMM Mode
- Create UCS Service Profiles and Templates

### Use Cases

- Create Pools
- Create Policies
- Create UCS Domain Profiles and attach Fabric Interconnects to the profiles
- Create Service Profiles and Templates and deploy physical infrastructure

### Intersight Pools

This set of modules support creating the following Pool Types:

- FC Pools
- IP Pools
- IQN Pools
- MAC Pools
- UUID Pools

### Intersight Policies

This set of modules support creating the following Policy Types:

- Adapter Configuration
- BIOS
- Boot Order
- Certificate Management
- Device Connector
- Ethernet Adapter
- Ethernet Network
- Ethernet Network Control
- Ethernet Network Group
- Ethernet QoS
- Fibre Channel Adapter
- Fibre Channel Network
- Fibre Channel QoS
- IMC Access
- Flow Control
- IPMI Over LAN
- iSCSI Adapter
- iSCSI Boot
- iSCSI Static Target
- LAN Connectivity
- LDAP
- Link Aggregation
- Link Control
- Local User
- Multicast
- Network Connectivity
- NTP
- Persistent Memory
- Port
- Power
- SAN Connectivity
- SD Card
- Serial over LAN
- SMTP
- SNMP
- SSH
- Storage
- Switch Control
- Syslog
- System QoS
- Thermal
- Virtual KVM
- Virtual Media
- VLAN
- VSAN

### Intersight Profiles and Templates

This set of modules support creating the following Profile Types:

- Kubernetes Cluster Profile
- UCS Chassis Profile
- UCS Domain Profile
- UCS Server Profile
- UCS Server Template - Important Note.  The script only uses Server Templates for holding policies.  This allows for flexibility around allowing the script to override policies by assigning unique policies to servers that is not supported by standard templates.

To sum this up... the goal is to deploy the infrastructure using Terraform through an easy to consume wizard.
